I am currently working towards my PhD in statistics at Northwestern University. I am advised by Prof. Noelle I. Samia and Prof. Bruce Spencer. My specialties include spatial temporal statistics with applications in health policy and criminology. I have an interest in survey sampling, data visualization, and statistics pedagogy.  I am the current President and Founder of Women in Statistics at Northwestern \href{https://wistnu.netlify.app/}{(WIST)}. When I am not doing my statistical work, I'm is playing with my dog Delta, out volunteering in the community, or practicing my artistry with makeup.
